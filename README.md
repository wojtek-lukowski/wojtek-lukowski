Hi, my name is Wojtek Lukowski,

I am a Software Engineer with a UX Design Background

I find pleasure in a constant debugging and I am always looking forward to a new error message as a progress indicator.
I work with HTML | CSS/SCSS | JavaScript | Node | Express | React | React Native | Angular | MongoDB and many more.
